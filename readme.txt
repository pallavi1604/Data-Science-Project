In this project, we have used a credit card dataset which consists of various transaction related features and the objective is to cluster the similar instances together

We first perform some preprocessing techniques to standardise and normalize the dataset.

After that, we uses DBSCAN for making clusters. In different instances of DBSCAN, we give different values of eps and min_samples , which are the input parameters.

Then we observe different results for different combinations of input parameters.
